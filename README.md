I'm a Physics Ph.D. based in Toronto entering Data Science.

One of the highlights of my journey so far has been my involvement in machine learning projects where I have had the opportunity to deploy classification and predictive AI models, and monitor their performance and robustness. These projects have not only sharpened my skills using ML libraries, implementing ETL services, and back-testing numerical models, but have also enriched my ability for envisioning data-driven solutions in a business-oriented environment. 

My experience as a research assistant in Computational Physics has equipped me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, rigorous problem-solving skills, and the ability to work with complex datasets. As a research assistant, I gained hands-on experience working on optimization problems and parameter tuning, which allowed me to develop a keen eye to visualize solutions for intricate challenges linked to the ionization of atoms and molecules in strong fields. 

My background in Physics has imparted crucial skills to succeed as a Data Scientist:

 â€¢ I am an experienced cross-functional collaborator with data management expertise and a strong background in mathematics and statistical analysis to lead and manage projects of numerical modelling in Computational Physics.

 â€¢ I have excellent communication skills used to simplify and convey complex concepts to broad audiences gained by over 6 years of experience delivering oral presentations and group seminars.

 â€¢ I have managed projects and priorities related to the modelling of atoms and molecules in external fields to achieve a PhD in Computational Physics.

Looking forward to collaborating with like-minded people to tackle challenging problems and create thriving solutions.
